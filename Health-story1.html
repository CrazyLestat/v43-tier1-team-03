                        Once upon a time, there was a man named <span class="input-holder name"></span>  who loved to eat unhealthy food and rarely exercised. He thought that since he was <span class="input-holder" id="adjective-one"></span>, he didn't need to worry about keeping his heart healthy. However, one day, <span class="input-holder name"></span> experienced chest pains and shortness of breath. He went to see his doctor, who told him that he had a heart condition and needed to <span class="input-holder" id="verb-one"></span> some changes to his lifestyle to keep his heart <span class="input-holder" id="adjective-two"></span>.

                    </p>


                      <p class="card-text">
                        <span class="input-holder name"></span> was scared, but he knew he had to take his doctor's advice seriously. He started by making small changes to his diet, such as reducing his intake of sugary and <span class="input-holder" id="adjective-three"></span> foods and <span class="input-holder" id="verb-two"></span> his intake of <span class="input-holder noun-one"></span> and vegetables. He also began to exercise regularly, starting with short walks and gradually increasing his physical activity.
            </p>
                        
                      <p class="card-text">
                        As <span class="input-holder name"></span> began to <span class="input-holder" id="verb-one"></span> these changes, he noticed that he had more <span class="input-holder noun-two"></span> and felt better overall. He also <span class="input-holder" id="verb-three"></span> that taking care of his heart was not only important for his physical health but also for his mental health.
                </p>
                        
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Over time, <span class="input-holder name"></span>'s dedication to keeping his heart <span class="input-holder" id="adjective-two"></span> paid off. He no longer experienced chest pains, and his doctor was pleased with his <span class="input-holder noun-three"></span>. <span class="input-holder name"></span> felt grateful for the wake-up call he had received and knew that he would continue to prioritize his heart health for the rest of his life.
